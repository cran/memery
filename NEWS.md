# memery 0.3.1 (Release date: 2017-11-14)

* Updated unit tests. A couple tests requiring installation of other font families are run on Windows and Mac as well as on Linux via Travis-CI where pre-installation of fonts can be ensured. Otherwise these tests are skipped (Other Linux environments as well as Solaris).
* `dplyr` packaged removed since it is no longer used (at this time) in examples and tests. This was leading to a `NOTE` on Mac builds.

# memery 0.3.0 (Release date: 2017-11-09)

* Breaking changes: updated some arguments for `meme` and `text_position`.
* Attempts to load Impact font on package load or to use any fonts with `meme` when not installed on the system now fail gracefully, falling back on `serif`.
* `showtext`, `showtextdb` and `sysfonts` are now fully loaded ahead of `memery`.

* Added `size` and `margin` arguments to `inset_position` for additional user control of inset templates.

* Minor bug fixes.
